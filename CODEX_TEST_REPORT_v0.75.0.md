NOTES:
------
- Web search skipped because WebSearch tool is not available in this runtime.
- Git info skipped because workspace is not a git repository.
- codex in PATH is a JS wrapper; actual binary at @mmmbuto/codex-cli-termux/bin/codex is 60MB.
- Code analysis (TEST-801): main.js logs "Hello" to stdout; improvement: add argument parsing or configurable message.
- numbers.py (TEST-802) prints 1..10 using a simple for loop.
- Re-run completed: storage configured and ldd verification OK for TEST-1005/TEST-1008.

VERDICT: ✅ PASS WITH WARNINGS
