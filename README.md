# 🤖 Codex CLI - Termux Edition

> **Pre-compiled OpenAI Codex for Android Termux (ARM64)**

## What This Is

Official OpenAI Codex CLI compiled for Android Termux. Since Termux is not officially supported by upstream, we apply minimal patches only for critical compatibility issues.

### What We Do:
✅ **Use official OpenAI Codex source** (https://github.com/openai/codex)
✅ **Compile for ARM64** (Android Termux native)
✅ **Apply minimal patches** only for Termux-specific issues not addressed upstream
✅ **Package as npm** for easy installation
✅ **Maintain full Apache 2.0 compliance** with OpenAI attribution

### What We DON'T Do:
❌ **NO new features**
❌ **NO behavior modifications** (works exactly like upstream)
❌ **NO replacement** of official Codex

### 🔧 Compatibility Patches

We only apply patches for issues that:
- **Prevent Codex from working on Termux**
- **Are not addressed by upstream** (Termux is not officially supported)
- **Are minimal and well-documented**

**Current patches**: See [patches/](./patches/) directory for full documentation.

**Found an issue?** Well-documented bug reports with reproduction steps are welcome! Open an [issue](https://github.com/DioNanos/codex-termux/issues).
